# b25 - Understanding song relations

This repository contains the codebase for exploring how word embedding techniques can be adapted to model music recommendation systems. By drawing inspiration from natural language processing, the project treats playlists as collections of co-occurring songs, enabling the exploration of novel embedding approaches tailored to non-sequential data.

The project provides implementations of several established embedding models alongside innovative adaptations designed specifically for recommendation contexts. It serves as both a research framework and a practical tool for investigating how semantic relationships among songs can be captured and leveraged for improved recommendation performance.
